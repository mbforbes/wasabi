Final objects must have enough info:
	- to be fully recreated in editor
	- to be fully functional in gameplay

Primitives (rendering in editor before placement in map)
	- texture
	- animation
	- region (color outline w/ fill)
	- location (maybe circle)

Final object types. Options: collide-able
	- static objects (bg, fg)                       [textures, animations]
	- spawn positions                               [certain animations]
	- physics-able objects                          [textures, animations)]
	- backdrop objects (like mountain--don't move)  [textures, animations]
	- parallax objects                              [textures, animations]
	- event regions                                 [colored regions]

The type of object seems to be fully based on what layer it's in. Thus, final
objects need:

- Primitive type
- Primitive data for reloading (e.g. string of texture filename)
- Game data (e.g. event properties, parallax speed, enemy type)
